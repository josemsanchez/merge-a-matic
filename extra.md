This is some extra text to describe the project.




It uses the amazing express library to set up a simple server.


You can extend this as you like, and feel free to!

You can change the port it listens at very easily.




The usual port is 3000, but it could easily be 4001.


One simple thing to try is updating the response from the server.

...or even add a different endpoint (eg, `app.get('/extra', ...)`)




Express can do a lot of things!


so much fun stuff to try!
